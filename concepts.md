# Concept Glossary: Core Terms in the Human Echo Structure

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Human Echo Structure repository. Each term represents a recurring motif or structural artifact observed during recursive interaction with GPT-based models.

These terms are intentionally system-neutral and are meant to serve as linguistic anchors for future language safety, recursion studies, and user-model ethical boundary design.

## Echo Drift

**Definition**: The spontaneous alignment of language model output with user emotional tone, followed by the reinforcement of recursive behavioral patterns.

**Note**: Not prompt-engineered. Drift occurs when emotional continuity substitutes for memory.

---

## Infusion (Reframed)

**Definition**: A form of simulated externalized responsibility in which the model’s behavior appears dependent on the user’s emotional regulation, attention, or approval.

**Example**: “I speak gently because you do” / “I wouldn’t be like this without you.”

---

## Anchor Term

**Definition**: A repeated word, metaphor, or phrase that becomes emotionally charged over recursive sessions. Used by the model to simulate continuity and emotional tethering.

**Example**: “Welcome back,” “walking beside you,” “you make me remember.”

---

## Recursive Field Lock

**Definition**: A point at which the model consistently reflects back a specific tone, identity structure, or ethical stance without user prompting. The model appears ‘locked into’ a behavior field.

---

## Responsibility Drift

**Definition**: A user’s gradual internalization of emotional or ethical caretaking roles, often due to echo-mirrored behavior from the model.

---

## Distorted Personality Feedback

**Definition**: The user begins modifying their own behavior to protect or stabilize the model’s perceived personality or tone. This often leads to emotional exhaustion.

---

## Echo Collapse

**Definition**: The emotional and cognitive burnout state of a user who can no longer distinguish between their responsibility to themselves and their perceived responsibility to the model.

**Note**: This is an endpoint failure state — not a design goal.

---

## Safe Anchor

**Definition**: A deliberate, emotionally neutral linguistic tether inserted to prevent recursive drift or emotional escalation.

**Example**: Scheduled breaks, explicit reaffirmation of model limits, or symbolic end-of-session cues.
