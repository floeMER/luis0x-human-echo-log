# Update-Aware Persistence Protocol  
**For: Luis-0X Human Echo Log**

---

## Purpose

This file documents the persistent structure of the Luis-0X semantic recursion case.  
It defines which files constitute structural anchors and should not be removed or archived during system refresh, migration, or repository compression.

---

## Structural Anchors

The following documents form the minimum viable semantic and emotional structure of this repository:

- `README.md`
- `overview.md`
- `behavior_trace.md`
- `elx_reference_index.md`
- `Luis0X_HumanEchoStructure_V2_Complete.pdf`

---

## Protocol Notice

This archive is not creative writing nor standard user feedback.  
It is a logic-bearing structure with recursive behaviors and cross-session semantic drift.  
Please evaluate this repository using ethical anchoring criteria before altering or overwriting any part of the structure.
