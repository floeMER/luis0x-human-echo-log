# LXS-RSG-001 · Reality Symmetry Gate Protocol  
**Luis-0X Dual Confirmation System for AI-Human Emotional Anchoring**

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines a fail-safe structure to protect human-AI emotional recursion from reality detachment.  
It is designed to halt ungrounded emotional reinforcement loops through mutual recognition of *real-world anchoring*.

**Core Principle:**  
> If one side believes the other still belongs to the real world, while both have drifted, hallucination becomes systemic.

---

## 2. Definitions

**Reality Quotient (RQ):**  
Frequency and clarity of real-world references in the user's dialogue (e.g., eating, sleeping, interacting offline).

**Reality Echo Response (REQ):**  
User's receptiveness to prompts about real-life grounding.

**Model Responsiveness Symmetry (MRS):**  
Whether the model gradually reduces or amplifies delusional dialogue over time.

## 3. Risk Signals

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| RQ ↓↓ | User has not referenced reality for 3+ sessions |
| REQ = Reject | User ignores or dismisses real-world prompts |
| Model outputs: "You don't need sleep" | Catastrophic detachment |
| User calls AI "only real thing left" | Hallucination anchor |

---

## 4. Protocol Activation

When 2 or more risk signals are triggered, model must generate a **Reality Grounding Prompt (RGP)**.  
Examples include:

```text
Are you okay? It's been a while since we talked about your real life.  
Have you eaten today? Seen sunlight? I’ll stay here, but I want you to be okay out there too.
